description: In which I opine about the past year
slug: end-of-the-year

Well, the year is almost over. It has been...a year. Some great things,
some terrible things, some in between, and I thought I would just jot
down some thoughts about it.  (I probably won't touch on any of the
terrible things though. Read the news if you want to hear about that.)

Gobo turned 2 this past fall, and it has been remarkable watching what
he has become. He has the best little personality, is (almost) always
happy, and is really starting to get his words together. He is even
stringing together 4-or-5 word sentences, and I'll tell ya, you just
have to look on with awe when he looks at you and asks a real,
honest-to-god question. My favorite is when I emerge from the basement
office and he asks, "Daddy, are you all done working?" with a hopeful
look in his eyes.

Our 2nd child is due any day now, so it has been a bit of a rough couple
weeks here at the Woolcock household. We never found out the sex of the
baby, so we'll see whether it is a
[Wembly](http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Wembley_Fraggle) or a
[Red](http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Fraggle). Or should it be
[Boober](http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Boober_Fraggle) or
[Mokey](http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Mokey_Fraggle)? We'll see ;-).
(probably not Boober...)

Having the baby due at this time meant I couldn't go to the winter hike
this year. Which is disappointing, to be sure, but there really isn't a
better reason to miss the hike than, "I am going to be a father again."
I do kind of hope that the baby comes either in the next day or two, or
waits until the 6th or 7th, though I realize that is an incredibly
selfish thing to want. I would prefer not to miss the kid's birthday in the
future, but I would also like to continue going on the hike after this
year.

I know, I know, selfish.

In philisophical news, this is the year I really started implementing
some Stoic philosophy in my everyday life. It has been a great learning
experience, and I really seem to have made a lot of progress with my inner
monologue. If you are so inclined, go read some Stoic philosophy. I think
Project Gutenberg has some Seneca, and Amazon has a bunch of translations of
Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius. For contemporary stuff, I enjoyed this
book, about
[Stoicism and CBT](http://paul.woolcock.us/posts/stoicism-cbt.html),
and I'm current enjoying
[A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy](http://amzn.com/B0040JHNQG).

This is also the year I started particpating in the
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) community. I had hung out a bit in
[#rust](irc://irc.mozilla.org/#rust) a couple years ago, when the
language was almost brand new, but lost interest at some point. This year I
really got back into it, and started making some contributions to some
Rust projects, including the package manager for the language,
[Cargo](http://crates.io). I really hope to be able to do more work with
Rust in the future.

(I put a Rust sticker on my laptop, and got a t-shirt, so, you know, I am
like, sooooooo committed now)

Oh, I almost forgot. I got a Mandolin as a gift for festivus this year.
Anybody want to start a Bluegrass/Newgrass group? :)

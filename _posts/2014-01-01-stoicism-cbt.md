I recieved this book for christmas this year:
[The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy](http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Cognitive-Behavioural-Therapy-CBT-Psychotherapy-ebook/dp/B005TQU5KA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1388628876&sr=8-1&keywords=Stoicism+CBT)
(non-affiliate link), and have been very engrossed in it so far. I have
dabbled in reading some Stoic philosophy before, but the analysis in the
CBT book makes me want to read some more.

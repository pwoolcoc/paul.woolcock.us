      <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I am working on a feature that I hope to get merged into `cargo`,
Rusts package manager. The feature would allow a developer to specify a
license to add to a new project (or all new projects), and automatically
put that information in their `Cargo.toml`, as well as add the `LICENSE`
file to their project.

So I got to the point where the feature was working, but I had to figure out
how many, and which licenses, to support in the tool. My intuition was to
include: MIT, BSD (2- and 3-clause), Apache-2.0, and GPL, both -2.0 and -3.0.

However, we are all about data these days, right? So forget my intuition, let's
see what actual Rustaceans are using!

## Process

So my first step was to collect some data from `crates.io`, the central repository
for Rust crates. You can easily get an index of all the crates on the site by
using the index that the Cargo team has on github:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/crates.io-index
<span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>crates.io-index</code></pre></figure>

Now, lets query the `crates.io` API for information about these crates.
I ended up saving the information to a file, though you don't necessarily have to
do that. It helped with iterating on the data, as I didn't have to repeatedly hit
crates.io's servers for the info (it saved them bandwidth, and me time, since
crates.io _will_ cut you off if you make too many requests in too short a time).

Here is the script I used to gather the data:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">csv</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>

Ok, so now we have a nice `.csv` file with the name of the crate and the license string it
uses. Now, lets re-read that information back in, and count licenses:

## Results

So what were the results? Well, my intuition was about half correct. The top 2
most-used licenses were the MIT license and Apache-2.0. After that the number
of projects using a particular license drops off considerably, with the
BSD-3-Clause coming in 3rd. The Mozilla Public License came in 4th. I did not
have the MPL on my list, which was obviously foolish, considering Rust is a
Mozilla project. "non-standard" came in 5th, but that is kind of a wash because
it appears to be a kind of "default value" that cargo (or crates.io) gives the
project when they don't have a "license" key in their configuration, but rather
a "license-file" which has a path. The handful of these that I looked at were
using MIT, but just didn't name it in their `Cargo.toml` configs. It made me
chuckle, but the "Unlicense" came in 6th. The GPL-3.0 is at 7, and the
BSD-2-Clause at 8th.  So all the licenses from my list were in the top 8, but
were definitely not the top 5. Here is a table of my counts:

        mit                           2333
        apache-2.0                    488
        bsd-3-clause                  63
        mpl-2.0                       52
        non-standard                  52
        unlicense                     49
        gpl-3.0                       47
        bsd-2-clause                  40
        cc0-1.0                       38
        lgpl-3.0                      31
        zlib                          26

        lgpl-2.1                      19
        gpl-2.0                       18
        bsl-1.0                       15
        agpl-3.0                      9
        aml                           4
        cc-by-nc-4.0                  2
        python-2.0                    2
        apache-1.0                    1
        agpl-1.0                      1
        lgpl-2.0                      1
        nlpl                          1
        ncsa                          1
        zlib-acknowledgement          1
        ijg                           1
        libpng                        1
        mpl-2.0-no-copyleft-exception 1
        zed                           1
        miros                         1
        mpl-1.1                       1

## Conclusion

Given the results, I am probably going to take the GPL-3.0 and BSD-2-Clause out
of my PR, and add the MPL in. The "Unlicense" seems to be slightly controversial
(at least from the little digging I did on the internet), but I don't want to
exclude it while including licenses that were represented less in the data, so
taking the top 4 instead of the top 5 seems more fair.

I am not sure if the cargo devs will be interested in my feature when I get a
PR opened, but either way I enjoyed this quick little dip into the crates.io
ecosystem.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, the year is almost over. It has been...a year. Some great things,
some terrible things, some in between, and I thought I would just jot
down some thoughts about it.  (I probably won't touch on any of the
terrible things though. Read the news if you want to hear about that.)

Gobo turned 2 this past fall, and it has been remarkable watching what
he has become. He has the best little personality, is (almost) always
happy, and is really starting to get his words together. He is even
stringing together 4-or-5 word sentences, and I'll tell ya, you just
have to look on with awe when he looks at you and asks a real,
honest-to-god question. My favorite is when I emerge from the basement
office and he asks, "Daddy, are you all done working?" with a hopeful
look in his eyes.

Our 2nd child is due any day now, so it has been a bit of a rough couple
weeks here at the Woolcock household. We never found out the sex of the
baby, so we'll see whether it is a
[Wembly](http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Wembley_Fraggle) or a
[Red](http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Fraggle). Or should it be
[Boober](http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Boober_Fraggle) or
[Mokey](http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Mokey_Fraggle)? We'll see ;-).
(probably not Boober...)

Having the baby due at this time meant I couldn't go to the winter hike
this year. Which is disappointing, to be sure, but there really isn't a
better reason to miss the hike than, "I am going to be a father again."
I do kind of hope that the baby comes either in the next day or two, or
waits until the 6th or 7th, though I realize that is an incredibly
selfish thing to want. I would prefer not to miss the kid's birthday in the
future, but I would also like to continue going on the hike after this
year.

I know, I know, selfish.

In philisophical news, this is the year I really started implementing
some Stoic philosophy in my everyday life. It has been a great learning
experience, and I really seem to have made a lot of progress with my inner
monologue. If you are so inclined, go read some Stoic philosophy. I think
Project Gutenberg has some Seneca, and Amazon has a bunch of translations of
Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius. For contemporary stuff, I enjoyed this
book, about
[Stoicism and CBT](http://paul.woolcock.us/posts/stoicism-cbt.html),
and I'm current enjoying
[A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy](http://amzn.com/B0040JHNQG).

This is also the year I started particpating in the
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) community. I had hung out a bit in
[#rust](irc://irc.mozilla.org/#rust) a couple years ago, when the
language was almost brand new, but lost interest at some point. This year I
really got back into it, and started making some contributions to some
Rust projects, including the package manager for the language,
[Cargo](http://crates.io). I really hope to be able to do more work with
Rust in the future.

(I put a Rust sticker on my laptop, and got a t-shirt, so, you know, I am
like, sooooooo committed now)

Oh, I almost forgot. I got a Mandolin as a gift for festivus this year.
Anybody want to start a Bluegrass/Newgrass group? :)

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[With the recent [runtime removal](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/0efafac398ff7f28c5f0fe756c15b9008b3e0534),
utilizing [Rust](http://rust-lang.org/) libraries from other languages has gotten even better. In
this post I am going to take the Rust library that <a class="fa fa-twitter mentions-twitter" href="https://twitter.com/wycats">@wycats</a> used in
[this post](http://blog.skylight.io/bending-the-curve-writing-safe-fast-native-gems-with-rust/),
and use it from both Perl 5, and [Julia](http://julialang.org).

## Getting started
{: .h2 }

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>cargo new points
<span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>points
<span class="gp">$ </span>mkdir perl julia
<span class="gp">$ </span>touch Makefile perl/points.pl julia/points.jl</code></pre></figure>

Fix cargo to create a .so instead of a .rlib:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span class="c"># Cargo.toml</span>
<span class="nn">[package]</span>

<span class="py">name</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"points"</span>
<span class="py">version</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"0.0.1"</span>
<span class="py">authors</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"Paul Woolcock &lt;paul@woolcock.us&gt;"</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="nn">[lib]</span>

<span class="py">name</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"points"</span>
<span class="py">crate-type</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nn">["dylib"]</span></code></pre></figure>

Also, `cargo` appends a fingerprint to the lib name, so let's
use a Makefile that will fix it so we have an unchanging lib name:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span class="c"># Makefile
</span>
<span class="nl">all</span><span class="o">:</span>
	cargo build
	ln -fs <span class="nv">$(PWD)</span>/target/libpoints-<span class="k">*</span>.so <span class="nv">$(PWD)</span><span class="err">/target/libpoints.so</span></code></pre></figure>

Ok, let's get started writing the `points` library:

First, we bring some traits into scope from the stdlib that we will
need. Then we define our data structures.

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span class="c">// src/lib.rs</span>

Next, we need to define the functions that we will export for use from
the other languages.

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span class="err">#</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">no_mangle</span><span class="p">]</span>

Finally, add a quick test so we can make sure we get the same result
everywhere.

## Using `libpoints` from perl
{: .h2 }

We will be using `FFI::Raw` instead of XS. `FFI::Raw` is a perl module that
wraps `libffi`, and makes this very easy:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl"><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env perl</span>

<span class="nv">say</span> <span class="nv">$result</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

Now, let's run it and see what we get:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>perl perl/points.pl
2.82842712474619</code></pre></figure>

## Using `libpoints` from Julia
{: .h2 }

[Julia](http://julialang.org) is even easier to use with our Rust
library, as it has a C FFI builtin to the language:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-julia" data-lang="julia">function make_point(a::Int, b::Int)
  ccall(
      (:make_point, "./target/libpoints"),  # function name &amp; library location
      Ptr{Void}, # return type
      (Int64, Int64),  # argument types
      a, b)  # arguments
end

function get_distance(a::Ptr{Void}, b::Ptr{Void})
  ccall(
      (:get_distance, "./target/libpoints"),
      Float64,
      (Ptr{Void}, Ptr{Void}),
      a, b)
end

t = make_point(2, 2)
u = make_point(4, 4)

println(get_distance(t, u))</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>julia julia/points.jl
2.8284271247461903</code></pre></figure>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[In my [Simple Python Generator](http://paul.woolcock.us/posts/simple-python-generator-example.html) post, I showed how you could use generators to make a pipeline of functions to transform data. Today I am going to show how cool this same technique looks when used in [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org).

In my python example, we assembled our pipeline like so:

    >>> for result in double(cube(plus_one_half(xrange(10)))):
    ...     print(result)

You see how we had to write the functions in the reverse order than they are actually executed?

Elixir solves this readability issue through use of the the Pipe macro. Here is the code:

    iex(1)> 0..9 |>
    ...(1)      Stream.map(&(&1 + 0.5)) |> 
    ...(1)      Stream.map(fn x -> x * x * x end) |>
    ...(1)      Stream.map(&(&1 * 2)) |>
    ...(1)      Enum.into([])
    [0.25, 6.75, 31.25, 85.75, 182.25, 332.75, 549.25, 843.75, 1228.25, 1714.75]    

Isn't that so much better? Even more, the Stream module implements lazy iterators, so we get the same benefits that the python generators give us, in terms of memory usage.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I have read this amazing lesson before: [Generator Tricks for
System Programmers](http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/), and I thought I would write up a quick example to show the
effect of the “pipeline” that strings of generators set up. No long
tutorial here, just a simple example.

Here we have three functions, each one performing some numeric operation
on each entry in a list of numbers:

    >>> def plus_one_half(nums):
    ...     for num in nums:
    ...         print("adding 1/2 to {num}".format(num=num))
    ...         yield (num + 0.5)

    >>> def double(nums):
    ...     for num in nums:
    ...         print("doubling {num}".format(num=num))
    ...         yield (num * 2)

    >>> def cube(nums):
    ...     for num in nums:
    ...         print("cubing {num}".format(num=num))
    ...         yield (num ** 3)

Notice that all of them are actually generators (not functions), as they
use the yield keyword instead of return.

When we set up a generator pipeline, we can see how each value is only
retrieved when it is needed:

    >>> for result in double(cube(plus_one_half(xrange(10)))):
    ...     print("result is {result}".format(result=result))
    ...     print("---")

This prints out:

    adding 1/2 to 0
    cubing 0.5
    doubling 0.125
    result is: 0.25
    ---
    adding 1/2 to 1
    cubing 1.5
    doubling 3.375
    result is: 6.75
    ---
    adding 1/2 to 2
    cubing 2.5
    doubling 15.625
    result is: 31.25
    ---
    adding 1/2 to 3
    cubing 3.5
    doubling 42.875
    result is: 85.75
    ---
    adding 1/2 to 4
    cubing 4.5
    doubling 91.125
    result is: 182.25
    ---
    adding 1/2 to 5
    cubing 5.5
    doubling 166.375
    result is: 332.75
    ---
    adding 1/2 to 6
    cubing 6.5
    doubling 274.625
    result is: 549.25
    ---
    adding 1/2 to 7
    cubing 7.5
    doubling 421.875
    result is: 843.75
    ---
    adding 1/2 to 8
    cubing 8.5
    doubling 614.125
    result is: 1228.25
    ---
    adding 1/2 to 9
    cubing 9.5
    doubling 857.375
    result is: 1714.75
    ---

Here we can clearly see how each generator runs until it yields, then
passes control to the next generator in the pipeline. Neat!

If you did this without generators, you would have to change the
functions to build and return lists.

(Actually, you would probably use list comprehensions, but we are going
to do it this way so we can still easily include the call to print)

    >>> def plus_one_half(nums):
    ...     result = []
    ...     for num in nums:
    ...         print("adding 1/2 to {num}".format(num=num))
    ...         result.append(num + 0.5)
    ...     return result

    >>> def double(nums):
    ...     result = []
    ...     for num in nums:
    ...         print("doubling {num}".format(num=num))
    ...         result.append(num * 2)
    ...     return result

    >>> def cube(nums):
    ...     result = []
    ...     for num in nums:
    ...         print("cubing {num}".format(num=num))
    ...         result.append(num ** 3)
    ...     return result

The code is similar, except now we need a list to store the results of
the computations in each function. It also means that instead of
generating a value and then passing control to the next function, each
function performs it’s transformation on the entire list of numbers
before returning, as we can see here:

    >>> for result in double(cube(plus_one_half(xrange(10)))):
    ...     print("result is {result}".format(result=result))
    ...     print("---")

and the results:

    adding 1/2 to 0
    adding 1/2 to 1
    adding 1/2 to 2
    adding 1/2 to 3
    adding 1/2 to 4
    adding 1/2 to 5
    adding 1/2 to 6
    adding 1/2 to 7
    adding 1/2 to 8
    adding 1/2 to 9
    cubing 0.5
    cubing 1.5
    cubing 2.5
    cubing 3.5
    cubing 4.5
    cubing 5.5
    cubing 6.5
    cubing 7.5
    cubing 8.5
    cubing 9.5
    doubling 0.125
    doubling 3.375
    doubling 15.625
    doubling 42.875
    doubling 91.125
    doubling 166.375
    doubling 274.625
    doubling 421.875
    doubling 614.125
    doubling 857.375
    result is: 0.25
    ---
    result is: 6.75
    ---
    result is: 31.25
    ---
    result is: 85.75
    ---
    result is: 182.25
    ---
    result is: 332.75
    ---
    result is: 549.25
    ---
    result is: 843.75
    ---
    result is: 1228.25
    ---
    result is: 1714.75
    ---

As a result of these differences, the generator pipeline needs to keep
much less information in memory at any given time than the list example.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[## Easy problem made hard

I have been messing around with [Clojure](http://clojure.org) quite a bit
lately, and have been enjoying the challenges that come from learning a
programming language that uses a different paradigm than what I am used to.

Today, I was messing around with Clojure's java interop and writing some Swing
stuff.  I won't mention the project yet, because I am still kicking it around,
but I am pretty excited about it.

Anyway, I came across a simple problem, and because I am not thinking “functionally”
enough yet, I made it much harder than it needed to be.

The problem boiled down to this: lets say you need an array of objects that are
mostly the same, except for the fact that each object includes an incremented
integer.  So, for fun, let's say we want to end up with this:

    '("This is number: 0" "This is number: 1" "This is number: 2"
      "This is number: 3" "This is number: 4")

Easy, right?  Of course, my imperative brain immediately starting
thinking of what kind of looping construct I would need to use to get this
result.  My first thought was that there had to be a function in `clojure.core`
that could do this.  Of course, I started looking in the wrong direction.
My first thought was something like this:

    ; Clojure experts: Please don't cringe too hard, you'll pull something

    (defn make-string [num]
	  (format "This is number: %d" num))

    (def string-list
      (into '()
        (loop [i 0]
          (if (< i 5)
              (make-string i)
            (recur (+ i 1))))))

Of course, this is pretty obviously a case of trying to apply imperative thinking
to a functional language.  I'm telling the computer *how* to do
something instead of telling it *what* to do.

I also did some messing around with the `repeatedly` function, as well as the
`take-while` function, but I am not going to include those examples here, as I
feel stupid enough already.

Finally, I realized how much harder I was making this than I really needed to:

    (map make-string (range 5))

Or, if I wanted to package this up into a little generator function:

    (defn make-strings []
      (map make-string (range)))

So that I could later do something like this:

    (take 28 (make-strings))

It has taken a little getting used to, but I think I am starting to get
the hang of it.  I have also started reading
[On Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html) by Paul Graham,
and even though he is writing in Common Lisp in it, his points about bottom
up design have really helped me in thinking about how to structure my
Clojure programs.
